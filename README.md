# Scripts to scrape websites



Here's some scripts who aim to scrape some websites. This kind of work is really useful in term of data science value. There is no better way to obtain huge database.

Here's some examples :

## Basic scraping with IMDB (webscraping_imdb)

Here it's a simple script to obtain basic data on IMDB, it's a training script, to familiarize myself with scraping and BeautifulSoup


## Basic scraping with senscritique (webscraping_100crit)

Again, a training script to discover BeautifulSoup


## More complex scraping with Formatic (webscraping_link_formatic)

Here's thing get more complex, it's a script to obtain all the link for the formation in the site. 
The structure was specific hence tough. The page are loaded dynamically with AJAX and need some specification if you want to obtain all the link in all the pages.

## More complex scraping with tripadvisor (webscraping_tripadvisor)

Surely this script could be simplified, I will try to update him as soon as possible.

## Basic scraping with scrapy (scrapy_spider)

This script aim to familiarize myself with Scrapy.


## Future Development

- Develop more complxe Scrapy scripts

- Try and familiarize myself with Selenium

- Became very efficient with BeautifSoup.
