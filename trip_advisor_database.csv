"Booked this trip on a whim. The location was good and the views were amazing. However the real Hawaii cannot be seen from this location. It is a very busy upscale area, with upscale shopping. Venture out and you will find the real tropical beaches and people.The property itself fulfilled its needs, certainly is a beautiful place to stay.","October 11, 2020"
"Stayed here in June 2019. Was nice to sleep in. For price no breakfast included. Ate at restaurant there once almost $100 for 3 people, not worth it. Housekeeping was excellent,staff very friendly and helpful, pool way to small, and shallow, beach gets crowded, but lots of places to eat walking distance","September 9, 2020"
"Let's start with the room and view. I opted to get a room with a partial ocean view. Not worth the extra money. You would have to lean over the balcony to see the ocean. Was very misleading. If you look straight out the window, you see building. I pool area was very nice and there was a water slide that my grandson enjoyed. It resort is massive. It is a retail mecca if that is what you are looking for. Food is expensive and a challenge. There was not one meal we had that was either cold, mico waved or lacking in flavor. The constantly severed micro waved fries. When I sent them back they came over fried. I think they cook them in advance and then just warm them up. Rooms are a good size Best part of this vacation was getting a car and going to the other side of the island. Would not stay here again.","August 29, 2020"
